                <h2>Creature Feature</h2>
                <p>Invent a new creature by combining different parts of various animals. Give it a name, and make up an interesting fact about your creature. This should incorporate vocabulary words for animals and body parts, and it could also include numbers or colors as appropriate. If you're feeling especially creative, write a whole story (using Lenape and English) or draw a picture of your creature.</p>
                <div class="activity-content">
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>My creature has the naxka (hands) and weshkinkw (face) of a nahenem (raccoon), the tuhwepi (body) of an askaskontpat (duck), and the shemu (horn) of a unicorn. Its name is the Waddling Raccoon-icorn, and if you see one, it means you will soon discover trash that is actually treasure.</p>
